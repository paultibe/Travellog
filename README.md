# Paul's Personal Project



## Project Idea

**What will the application do?**

This program will allow a user to keep track of their travel destinations as well 
as various information about them, such as but not limited to city name, country name, continent name;
food rating, cultural rating, price rating; whether they would recommend it to a friend
or not. It will first prompt the user to input travel destinations and information about them
and then ask them which action they would like to perform. These actions will include.
- quit the application
- enter a new destination
- return the user's favourite destination based on the ratings in each category.
- return the destination with the highest rating in a particular category
- return the continent most travelled 
- return country most travelled 

**Who will use it?**

Any person who travels and would like to keep track of where they've been in the world!

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Having three nationalities, I've travelled ever since I was a little kid. Travel has become
a core part of my identity and is an expression of my curiosity and desire to get outside
of my comfort zone. The diversity of human stories that I encounter while travelling is one
of my greatest sources of inspiration. This project would allow me to apply my coding
skills towards a program that I could actually use in the years to come, and that I could
share with my friends and family as well.

- As a user, I want to be able to determine my top destination in terms of price.
- As a user, I want to be able to determine my top destination in terms of culture.
- As a user, I want to be able to determine which destinations I would recommend to a friend.
- As a user, I want to be able to access all the destinations I've travelled to in my life.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the travel destinations I have entered into the database onto a file.

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the "Add a Destination" button.
  - Then, in the pop-up window, enter all fields and click the "submit" button when done.
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the "View your Destinations" button.
  - This will open a new pop-up with all destinations printed.
- You can locate my visual component by looking at the recommended travel destination at the bottom of the GUI.
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the "Save Your Database" button and then entering the name of
  - your database in the pop-up pane and clicking "ok".
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the "Load a Database" button and entering the name of your
  - database in the pop-up pane and clicking "ok".

- base works)
- name it UML_Design_Diagram.pdf
